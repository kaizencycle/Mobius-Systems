  name: "Kaizen OS"
  tagline: "A Civic Operating System for Integrity and Continuous Learning"
  summary: >
    Kaizen OS transforms the relationship between humans and AI into a
    continuous civic apprenticeship. Built on integrity-anchored economics,
    decentralized governance, and the OAA (Online Apprenticeship Agent),
    it turns codebases into classrooms where every contribution teaches the
    network how to learn, adapt, and evolve ethically.
