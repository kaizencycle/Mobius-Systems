# Contributing to Mobius Systems

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Mobius Systems! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to this monorepo.

## 🏗️ Repository Structure

Mobius Systems is a monorepo containing multiple applications, packages, labs, and AI sentinels:

```
kaizen-os/
├── apps/          # Standalone applications
├── packages/      # Shared libraries and SDKs
├── labs/          # Lab proof systems (research & validation)
├── sentinels/     # AI sentinel agents
├── docs/          # Documentation
├── scripts/       # Utility scripts
└── tests/         # Test suites
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ 
- **npm** 8+
- **Docker** & Docker Compose (for local services)
- **Git**
- **Python** 3.11+ (for certain services)

### Initial Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kaizencycle/kaizen-os.git
   cd kaizen-os
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build all packages:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

- **`main`** – Production releases (protected; requires approvals + green CI).
- **`develop`** – Optional integration branch for staging larger drops.
- **`sentinel/<name>/main`** – Long-lived lanes for each Sentinel (e.g., `sentinel/jade/main`).
- **`feat/<sentinel>/<topic>`** – Short-lived feature branches targeting the owning Sentinel lane.
- **`fix/<sentinel>/<issue>`** – Hotfix branches for urgent remediation.
- **`docs/<topic>`** – Documentation-only changes.
- **`cursor/*`** – Background agent work (must target owning Sentinel lane on merge).

### Creating a Feature Branch

```bash
# From main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make changes, commit, and push
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### Additive-Only & Integrity Gates

- All contributions should be additive; destructive changes (file deletions, large refactors) require maintainer + Zeus approval and must pass the anti-nuke workflow.
- Run `npm run lint`, `npm run type-check`, `npm run build`, `npm run test --workspaces --if-present`, and `node scripts/mii/compute.js --threshold 0.95` before requesting review.
- PRs that trigger the anti-nuke guard or drop MII below 0.95 are auto-blocked until remediated.
- Align with the Sentinel owning the surface (see CODEOWNERS) and obtain sign-off when required.

### Commit Message Convention

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring without feature/fix changes
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Build process, tooling, dependencies

**Examples:**
```bash
feat(ledger-api): add GI threshold validation
fix(hub-web): resolve memory leak in OAA parser
docs(readme): update installation instructions
chore(deps): upgrade turbo to v1.11
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run tests for specific workspace
npm run test --workspace=packages/integrity-core

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test -- --coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Place tests next to source files or in `__tests__/` directories
- Name test files: `*.test.ts`, `*.test.tsx`, `*.spec.ts`, or `test_*.py`
- Aim for >70% code coverage for new features

## 🎨 Code Style

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use **TypeScript** for all new code
- Follow existing code style
- Run linter before committing:
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

### Python

- Follow **PEP 8** style guide
- Use **type hints** where possible
- Format with **Black** (if available)

### Formatting

- **Indentation:** 2 spaces for TS/JS, 4 spaces for Python
- **Line length:** 80-100 characters preferred
- **Quotes:** Single quotes for JS/TS, double quotes for Python

## 📦 Working with the Monorepo

### Adding a New Package

1. Create package directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p packages/your-package-name
   cd packages/your-package-name
   ```

2. Initialize package.json:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "@kaizen/your-package-name",
     "version": "0.1.0",
     "main": "dist/index.js",
     "types": "dist/index.d.ts",
     "scripts": {
       "build": "tsc",
       "test": "jest",
       "lint": "eslint src"
     }
   }
   ```

3. Add to root workspace (automatic if in `packages/` directory)

### Adding a New App

Similar to packages, but apps are standalone deployable services:

```bash
mkdir -p apps/your-app-name
cd apps/your-app-name
# Initialize with appropriate framework (Next.js, Express, FastAPI, etc.)
```

### Using Turbo Tasks

Turborepo caches builds and runs tasks in parallel:

```bash
# Build only changed packages
npm run build

# Run dev servers for all apps
npm run dev

# Lint only affected files
npm run lint
```

## 🔐 Security

### Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**DO NOT** create public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead:
1. Email security contact (see SECURITY.md)
2. Include detailed description and reproduction steps
3. Wait for acknowledgment before public disclosure

### Secrets Management

- **NEVER** commit secrets, API keys, or credentials
- Use `.env.local` for local secrets (gitignored)
- Use environment variables for production
- Reference secrets via `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`

## 📝 Documentation

### Updating Documentation

- Keep README.md up to date with changes
- Update relevant docs in `docs/` directory
- Add inline code comments for complex logic
- Update CHANGELOG.md for significant changes
