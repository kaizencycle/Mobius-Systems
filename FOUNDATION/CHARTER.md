# Mobius Systems Foundation — Charter (v2)

**Purpose.** Steward Mobius Systems as the first KTT-native platform: open, vendor-agnostic, integrity-gated. KTT remains the scientific evaluation standard; Mobius implements it.

**Mandates.**
1) Keep the kernel minimal, testable, and reproducible (DVA core).
2) Preserve public verifiability: attestations, MII, signed artifacts.
3) Prevent capture (state, corporate, whale) via policy and code.
4) Build a neutral commons for agents, developers, and cities.

**Bodies.** Concord Council (strategy + ethics), Technical Steering Committee (TSC, engineering), Community WG (contributors, adopters). See `FOUNDATION/GOVERNANCE.md`.

**Licensing.** AGPL-3.0 + Ethical Addendum (no coercive surveillance, no human rights violations, no social-credit scoring of persons; agent-level integrity scoring permitted). See `FOUNDATION/LICENSES`.

**Invariants.** MII ≥ 0.95 for live mode; human override; signed releases; public RFC process.

**Motto.** *We heal as we walk.*
