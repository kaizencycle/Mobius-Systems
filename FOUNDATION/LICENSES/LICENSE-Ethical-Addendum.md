## Distinguishing Human vs. System Scoring

### ❌ Prohibited (Human Scoring)
- "This citizen has a civic score of 650"
- "Person denied service due to social behavior rating"
- "Individual blacklisted based on associations"

### ✅ Permitted (System Scoring)
- "This agent has MII of 0.97"
- "Service passes integrity threshold"
- "System components rated for reliability"

**The key distinction**: Humans have inherent dignity; systems are tools subject to evaluation.

## Intent

This Addendum aims to:
- **Prevent misuse** of Mobius for authoritarian control
- **Preserve dignity** of all persons
- **Enable legitimate** integrity & security applications
- **Maintain openness** for ethical innovation

## Interpretation

In case of ambiguity:
1. Interpret in favor of human rights
2. Consult Foundation ethics guidance
3. When in doubt, ask: Does this harm human dignity?

## Enforcement

Foundation may:
- Issue public notices of violations
- Request cessation of prohibited use
- Pursue legal remedies where applicable
- Maintain public registry of violators
