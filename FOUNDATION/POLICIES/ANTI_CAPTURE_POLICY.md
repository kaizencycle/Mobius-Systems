# Anti-Capture Policy

## Purpose

Prevent concentration of power that could undermine Mobius Systems' neutral, open governance.

## Whale Limits

**MIC Governance Cap**: Any entity's effective voting power capped at **1%** of total governance weight.

### Implementation
- Calculated at proposal snapshot
- Applies to all entities (corporate, state, foundation, individual)
- Delegation counted toward delegate's cap
- Unlocked only by wide quorum (Council + TSC joint vote)

## State/Corporate Fork Prevention

**License Restrictions** (Ethical Addendum):
- Prohibits coercive surveillance systems
- Prohibits human social-credit scoring
- Prohibits warfare targeting civilians
- Requires human override mechanisms

Violators automatically lose license rights.

## Multi-Vendor Mandate

Mobius Systems MUST support at minimum:
- OpenAI (commercial)
- Anthropic (commercial)
- Google (commercial)
- Local inference (open-source)

**Monoculture dependency is grounds for emergency intervention.**

## Governance Concentration Limits

### Board/Council
- No single employer may have >2 seats (out of 7)
- No single nationality may have >4 seats
- Vendors (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) cannot hold seats

### TSC
- No single organization >33% of seats
- Vendor employees limited to advisory (non-voting)

## Hard Fork Trigger

**Automatic if any entity accumulates:**
- >15% of validator weight
- >15% of attestation volume
- >20% of MIC governance weight (circumventing cap)

**Fork Process:**
1. Automated alert to Council + TSC
2. Emergency session within 7 days
3. Fork or remediation vote
4. Public disclosure of threat

## Institutional Independence

Foundation is **transnational**:
- No single host state governs the protocol
- Governing law = chosen neutral jurisdiction
- Financial independence (no >25% from single source)
- Multi-cloud deployment (no single provider dependency)

## Economic Anti-Capture

### MIC Design
- **Epoch Decay**: Idle balances decay 0.2%/epoch
- **Burn on Vote**: Modest burn (10-20%) on governance use
- **No Hoarding**: Storage costs (technical + economic)
- **UBI**: Broad distribution after 1,000+ attestants

### GIC → MIC Transition
Historical GIC holders subject to same caps post-rename.

## Monitoring

Quarterly reports track:
- Governance weight distribution
- Validator concentration
- Attestation volume by entity
- COI disclosures
- Vendor influence metrics

## Remediation

If capture attempted:
1. **Alert**: Public disclosure
2. **Freeze**: Temporary governance pause
3. **Rebalance**: Technical or policy changes
4. **Fork**: If necessary to preserve neutrality

## Philosophy

**"Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty."**

Mobius must remain:
- Model-agnostic
- Vendor-neutral
- Politically independent
- Community-governed
- Anti-authoritarian
