# Privacy Policy (Project Data)

## Core Principle

**Mobius Systems avoids personal data in Civic/Mobius Ledgers.**

Attestations contain system and agent metadata only. We do not score, track, or profile humans.

## What We Collect

### In Ledgers
- System/agent identifiers (not linked to persons)
- Integrity metrics (MII, attestation signatures)
- Timestamps and hash values
- Technical telemetry

### NOT Collected
- Personal names or identifiers
- Behavioral profiles of individuals
- Location data
- Biometric information
- Social graphs or relationships

## Contributor Data

### Git Commits
- Email addresses and usernames appear per Git commit norms
- Public by nature of Git history
- Can be pseudonymized at contribution time

### Removal Requests
We honor removal requests when feasible. However:
- Cannot rewrite public Git history
- Cannot remove cryptographically attested data
- Can anonymize future references

## Data Minimization

Following privacy-by-design principles:
- Collect only necessary metadata
- Use cryptographic hashes instead of raw data
- Apply differential privacy where applicable
- Short retention periods for operational data

## Third-Party Services

When using Mobius-hosted services:
- Read third-party privacy policies (GitHub, cloud providers)
- We do not sell or share contributor data
- Aggregate anonymized metrics only for system improvement

## Rights

You have the right to:
- Know what data exists about you
- Request corrections
- Request deletion (where technically feasible)
- Export your contribution history
