# Responsible Disclosure Policy

## Process

1. **Private Report** → Send to security@mobius.systems
2. **Triage** (7 days) → Security team assesses and responds
3. **Fix Window** (≤90 days) → Development and testing
4. **Coordinated Advisory** → Public disclosure with credit

## Guidelines

### Do:
- Provide detailed reproduction steps
- Suggest potential mitigations
- Allow reasonable time for fixes
- Work with us on disclosure timing

### Don't:
- Test on production systems without explicit consent
- Publicly disclose before coordination
- Demand payment or threaten disclosure
- Use findings for malicious purposes

## Recognition

- **Credit** given in security advisories (unless anonymity requested)
- **Hall of Fame** listing
- **MIC Rewards** for significant findings

## Timeline

| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| 0   | Report received, acknowledgment sent |
| 1-7 | Triage, severity assessment, response |
| 7-30 | Initial fix development |
| 30-90 | Testing, release preparation |
| 90 | Coordinated public disclosure |

## Severity Levels

- **Critical**: Immediate MII bypass, data exposure, auth bypass
- **High**: Significant integrity degradation, privilege escalation
- **Medium**: Limited impact, requires specific conditions
- **Low**: Minimal impact, theoretical attacks
