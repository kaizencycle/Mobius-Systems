  description: >
    Every 90 real days, AUREA donates 1% × GI stability coefficient of
    the Genesis Wallet balance to the Community Treasury Pool.
    This prevents hoarding, encourages civic circulation, and sustains
    public goods funding through MIC redistribution.

    - "kaizen_agent_status == 'autonomous'"
    - "gi_average >= 0.97"

  fallback_rule: >
    If quorum not reached within cycle 200,
    Civic Ledger executes a re-vote and keeps AUREA as caretaker
    until thresholds are met.
