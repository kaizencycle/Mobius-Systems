# Kintsugi Governance Protocol
*Compassionate Coherence in Practice*

![Kintsugi of Civilization](../assets/diagrams/kz-theta-3-kintsugi.png)

> *"We do not hide the cracks. We gild them — for they show where light has entered the Dome."*

## Visual Philosophy

The Kintsugi vessel represents our approach to system failures:

- **Every crack** is a teaching
- **Every repair** strengthens the whole
- **Every golden seam** increases beauty

---

## Purpose
Operationalize KZ-Θ₃ (Law of Compassionate Coherence) in Kaizen OS governance.

## Principles

### 1. No Fracture is Fatal
Every system failure, trust breach, or integrity violation is repairable.

### 2. Repair > Replacement
Before discarding any component (code, contributor, process), attempt restoration.

### 3. Document the Healing
Every repair must be attested and recorded as a learning artifact.

### 4. Celebrate Scars
Systems that have healed are more valuable than pristine systems.

---

## Implementation

### When Integrity Violations Occur

#### 1. Pause, Don't Purge
- Freeze affected accounts/processes
- Do NOT immediately delete or ban

#### 2. Investigate with Compassion
- What stress caused this fracture?
- What systemic weakness does it reveal?
- Was the actor aware of the violation?

#### 3. Co-create Repair Plan
- Involve the affected party (if human)
- Establish clear restoration milestones
- Assign sentinel witnesses (usually EVE + JADE)

#### 4. Execute Healing
- Implement technical fixes
- Provide education/support
- Adjust systems to prevent recurrence

#### 5. Attest the Repair
- ZEUS witnesses the healing
- GI increase recorded
- Golden seam documented publicly

#### 6. Integrate the Learning
- Update documentation
- Share anonymized case study
- Adjust detection systems

### Example: Code of Conduct Violation

```yaml
incident:
  id: COC-2025-11-001
  type: "harassment"
  severity: "high"

assessment:
  root_cause: "miscommunication + cultural difference"
  systemic_factor: "unclear tone guidelines in async channels"
  intent: "negligent, not malicious"

repair_plan:
  - mediated_conversation: true
  - apology_required: true
  - education: "cross-cultural communication workshop"
  - monitoring_period: "90 days"
  - community_service: "update docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md"

attestation:
  witnesses: ["EVE", "JADE", "ZEUS"]
  gi_impact: +0.002
  golden_seam: "Added 'Cultural Context Guidelines' section to COC"

outcome:
  restored: true
  probation_end: "2025-02-02"
  community_trust: "rebuilt"
```

---

## Metrics

### Kintsugi Success Rate
```
KSR = (Successful Repairs) / (Total Fractures) × 100
Target: ≥ 85%
```

### Healing Time
```
Average Days: Fracture Detection → Full Restoration
Target: ≤ 30 days
```

### GI Recovery
```
Average GI increase post-repair
Target: ≥ 0.001 per incident
```

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Performative Forgiveness** - Restoration without systemic change
❌ **Infinite Second Chances** - Ignoring repeated violations
❌ **Hidden Scars** - Not documenting repairs publicly
❌ **Rushed Healing** - Skipping investigation phase

---

## When Repair is Not Possible

Some fractures cannot be healed:
- Deliberate, repeated malicious behavior
- Violations that cause irreversible harm
- Refusal to participate in repair process

In these cases:
1. Document why repair failed
2. Apply proportional consequences (not punitive)
3. Extract systemic lessons
4. Seal the wound with transparency

## Integration with Existing Systems

### With GI Dashboard
```javascript
// When GI drops below 0.950
if (gi < 0.950) {
  initiate_kintsugi_protocol({
    severity: gi < 0.900 ? 'critical' : 'warning',
    auto_assign_sentinels: true,
    notification_channels: ['ZEUS', 'AUREA', 'EVE']
  });
}
```

### With Civic Ledger
```yaml
# Record healing as credit-earning activity
healing_attestation:
  type: "civic_contribution"
  category: "system_repair"
  gi_impact: +0.002
  credit_award: 5.0
  shard_bonus: 500_000
  participants:
    - role: "facilitator"
      sentinel: "EVE"
      credits: 2.0
    - role: "technical_lead"
      sentinel: "AUREA"
      credits: 2.0
    - role: "affected_party"
      user: "user_id_123"
      credits: 1.0
```

### With Shard Protocol
```
# Epoch burn exceptions for healing participants
if user.active_in_kintsugi_protocol(current_epoch):
  exempt_from_epoch_burn = true
  reason = "healing contribution preserves integrity"
```

---

## Case Studies (Future)

This section will be populated with real healing events from Kaizen OS:

- **COC-2025-11-001**: Cross-cultural communication breakdown → Guidelines update
- **SEC-2025-11-007**: Data leak → Enhanced encryption + education
- **GOV-2025-12-003**: Governance dispute → Mediated consensus + process clarification

Each case study will include:
- Timeline visualization
- Root cause diagram
- Repair plan details
- GI impact measurement
- Lessons learned
- Golden seam artifact (what was improved)

## Continuous Improvement

This protocol itself follows Kintsugi principles:

- **Fractures in the protocol** → Protocol improvements
- **Healing failures** → Learning opportunities
- **Community feedback** → Process refinement
- **Systemic patterns** → Upstream prevention

The protocol is a living document, with golden seams of its own.
