## 🎯 Design Principles for This Guide

When writing content for this guide:

1. **Practical over philosophical** - Step-by-step, not abstract
2. **Assume zero context** - Reader may know nothing about Kaizen OS
3. **Include examples** - Real or hypothetical scenarios
4. **Provide templates** - Emails, announcements, rituals, oaths
5. **Link to resources** - Don't duplicate, reference
6. **Update regularly** - Living document, not static

---

## 🔮 Future Sections (Ideas)

Potential expansions for v2.0+:

- [ ] Multi-Custodian Coordination (when 2+ custodians active)
- [ ] Geographic Distribution Strategy (avoid single-country risk)
- [ ] Funding Models (grants, donations, sustainability)
- [ ] Crisis Scenarios (cyberattack, legal threat, schism)
- [ ] Technology Evolution (when AI capabilities change dramatically)
- [ ] 50-Year Vision (what does Kaizen OS look like in 2075?)
