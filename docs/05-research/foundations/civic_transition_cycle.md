# Civic Transition Cycle

## The Five-Phase Model: Fear → Trial → Necessity → Integration → Legacy

### Phase 1: Denial (Fear/Ridicule)
New systems face initial resistance and skepticism.

### Phase 2: Trial (Pilots)
Early adopters test and validate the system.

### Phase 3: Crisis (Necessity/Adoption)
External pressures drive mainstream adoption.

### Phase 4: Integration (Commons Backbone)
System becomes infrastructure for daily operations.

### Phase 5: Legacy (Invisible Substrate)
System becomes so fundamental it becomes invisible, like electricity or the internet.

**Historical Examples:**
- Electricity: Dangerous curiosity → Luxury → Necessity → Infrastructure → Invisible
- Internet: Military project → Academic tool → Commercial platform → Daily life → Invisible
- Integrity Economy: [We are here: Trial → Necessity transition]
