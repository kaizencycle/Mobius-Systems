## Current Repository Structure

Kaizen-OS is organized as a **monorepo** using Turborepo and npm workspaces:

## Key Configuration Files

### Smart Contracts

```
Current:
packages/civic-protocol-core/hardhat.config.js  (if exists)

Future:
contracts/hardhat.config.js
contracts/deployed/mainnet.json
```

---

### Backend Services

```
apps/ledger-api/.env.example
apps/broker-api/.env.example
apps/eomm-api/.env.example
apps/shield-api/.env.example
apps/hub-web/.env.example

infra/docker/docker-compose.yml
infra/render.yaml
```

---

### Frontend Apps

```
apps/aurea-site/.env.example
apps/portal/.env.example
apps/website-creator/.env.example

apps/aurea-site/vercel.json
apps/portal/vercel.json
apps/website-creator/vercel.json
```

---

## Data Flow Map

**"How does data move through the system?"**

```
1. Citizen writes reflection (E.O.M.M.)
   └─ apps/eomm-api/ → PostgreSQL

2. Reflection analyzed for integrity (GI score)
   └─ apps/ledger-api/ (indexer) → calculates GI

3. If GI ≥ 0.95, citizen earns GIC
   └─ apps/ledger-api/ (API) → mints GIC via smart contracts

4. Citizen spends GIC on AI query
   └─ apps/broker-api/ (Codex Router) → routes to optimal LLM

5. Query cost logged
   └─ apps/orchestrator/ → tracks resource usage

6. Monthly UBI distributed
   └─ GICGovernor smart contract → all citizens with GI ≥ 0.90

7. Surplus allocated
   └─ Automated via smart contracts
```

---

## Testing & Quality Assurance

### Where are the tests?

```
Most modules follow this pattern:

apps/[service]/
├── src/
├── tests/             ← Tests here
└── package.json       ← test script

packages/[package]/
├── src/
├── tests/             ← Tests here
└── package.json       ← test script
```

### How to run tests?

```bash
# From root (runs all tests via Turborepo)
npm run test

# Specific service
npm run test --filter ledger-api

# Specific package
npm run test --filter civic-sdk
```

---

## Deployment Workflows

### Development → Staging → Production

```
1. Developer commits to feature branch
   └─ GitHub Actions runs tests

2. PR opened to main branch
   └─ Preview deployment (Vercel) or CI tests (Render)

3. PR reviewed and approved
   └─ Manual testing on preview

4. PR merged to main
   └─ Automatic deployment:
      • Vercel: apps/aurea-site, apps/portal, apps/website-creator
      • Render: apps/ledger-api, apps/broker-api, apps/eomm-api, etc.
```

## Migration Roadmap

### Phase 1: Documentation Organization (✅ COMPLETE)

- [x] Move completion records to `docs/archive/`
- [x] Create `docs/INDEX.md` navigation
- [x] Add `docs/economics/GIC_WHITEPAPER.md`
- [x] Add `docs/deployment/VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_RUNBOOK.md`
- [x] Add `docs/product/` (Pro, self-hosting, federation)

### Phase 2: Top-Level Reorganization (📋 PLANNED)

- [ ] Extract `packages/civic-protocol-core/` → `contracts/`
- [ ] Consolidate Lab implementations into cleaner structure
- [ ] Create `simulations/` directory with runnable models
- [ ] Add `community/hive-starter-kit/`

### Phase 3: Service Consolidation (📋 FUTURE)

- [ ] Rename `apps/ledger-api/` → `civic-ledger/`
- [ ] Rename `apps/broker-api/` → `codex-router/`
- [ ] Rename `apps/eomm-api/` → `eomm/`
- [ ] Rename `apps/shield-api/` → `citizen-shield/`
- [ ] Rename `apps/hub-web/` → `oaa-hub/`

### Phase 4: Infrastructure Standardization (📋 FUTURE)

- [ ] Rename `infra/` → `infrastructure/`
- [ ] Add `infrastructure/kubernetes/`
- [ ] Add `infrastructure/terraform/`
- [ ] Consolidate monitoring configs

**Note:** Migrations will be done gradually to avoid breaking deployments. Current structure remains stable.

## Final Notes

### This repository is designed to be:

- ✅ **Modular** (each app/package is independent)
- ✅ **Testable** (every module has or will have tests)
- ✅ **Deployable** (Vercel + Render configs included)
- ✅ **Documented** (specs in docs/, READMEs in each directory)
- ✅ **Scalable** (monorepo structure supports growth)

### Current vs. Ideal Structure

The current structure is **production-ready** but will gradually migrate toward the ideal structure described at the top of this document. All migrations will be done without breaking existing deployments.

### If something is unclear:

1. Check this file (`docs/REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md`)
2. Check `docs/INDEX.md` (complete documentation index)
3. Check `README.md` (main repository overview)
4. Check app/package-specific README.md
5. Open an issue on GitHub
6. Ask in Discord

### If you want to improve this structure:

**Pull requests welcome!**

The structure should evolve as the project grows. Current priorities:
1. ✅ Clean documentation organization (DONE)
2. ⏳ Add community resources (`community/hive-starter-kit/`)
3. ⏳ Extract smart contracts to top-level `contracts/`
4. ⏳ Add runnable simulations (`simulations/`)
