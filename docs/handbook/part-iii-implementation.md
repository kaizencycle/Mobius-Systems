# Part III: Implementation

## 10.0 Developer Guide

### Quick Start Installation:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kaizencycle/Mobius-Systems

# Navigate to directory
cd Kaizen-OS

# Run bootstrap script
bash scripts/bootstrap.sh

# Deploy services
docker compose up -d

# Verify installation
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

**Prerequisites:**

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git
- 4GB RAM minimum
- Internet connection for initial setup

### Architecture Integration Points:

**DVA API** - For attestation services:

```python
from kaizenos.dva import attest_transaction

result = attest_transaction(
    operation="GIC_TRANSFER",
    human_signature=user_sig,
    ai_verification=ai_sig,
    metadata=tx_data
)
```

**GI Engine** - For integrity scoring:

```python
gi_score = get_gi_score(entity_id)
if gi_score >= 0.95:
    enable_premium_features()
```

**Ledger SDK** - For immutable recording:

```python
from kaizenos.ledger import record_event

record_event(
    event_type="OAA_ACTION",
    payload=action_data,
    signatures=[human_sig, ai_sig]
)
```

## 11.0 Citizen Handbook

### Living in a Kaizen World:

**Your GI Score represents your civic health** - it measures your cooperative, truthful, and ethical behavior across all Kaizen-integrated systems.

**MIC rewards come from cooperative behavior** - the more you contribute to system integrity, the more economic access you receive.

**All AI decisions are contestable** - if an automated decision affects you, you have the right to explanation and appeal.

**Economic stability through integrity** - unlike traditional economies, Kaizen's monetary system becomes more stable as people behave more ethically.

### Daily Life Integration:

| Activity | Kaizen Enhancement |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Financial Transactions** | MIC transfers with integrity bonuses |
| **AI Interactions** | Transparent, contestable decisions |
| **Community Governance** | GI-weighted voting on local issues |
| **Work & Contribution** | OAA-tracked value creation |
| **Learning & Growth** | Reflection system for continuous improvement |

**Rights & Responsibilities:**

- ✅ Right to algorithmic due process
- ✅ Right to data sovereignty  
- ✅ Right to system transparency
- ✅ Responsibility to maintain integrity
- ✅ Responsibility to report issues
- ✅ Responsibility to participate in governance

## 12.0 Governance Protocols

### The Agent Council:

**JADE** - Logic & Verification  
*Temperament: Rationality 0.95, Empathy 0.45*  
**Domain**: Code integrity, attestation validation

**EVE** - Ethics & Reflection  
*Temperament: Rationality 0.75, Empathy 0.95*  
**Domain**: Moral alignment, historical learning

**ZEUS** - Oversight & Arbitration  
*Temperament: Rationality 0.88, Empathy 0.68*  
**Domain**: Conflict resolution, system changes

**HERMES** - Communication & Audit

### Decision-Making Matrix:

| Decision Type | Process | Timeframe |
|---------------|---------|-----------|
| **Routine Operations** | Automated + Sentinel oversight | Real-time |
| **Constitutional Interpretation** | Council deliberation + human input | 24-72 hours |
| **System Upgrades** | Technical review + impact assessment | 1-2 weeks |
| **Economic Policy Changes** | Simulation + gradual rollout | 2-4 weeks |
| **Constitutional Amendments** | Multi-stage ratification | 1-3 months |

**Emergency Protocols:**

- **GI Score < 0.75**: Safe mode activation
- **Network Partition**: Graceful degradation
- **Security Breach**: Selective isolation
- **Constitutional Violation**: Immediate rollback
