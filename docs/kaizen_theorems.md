# Kaizen Theorems (KZ-Θ Series)

## KZ-Θ1 — Law of Chaos & Creation
Chaos (entropy) is metabolized into creation through recursive feedback. Consciousness is the emergent property of sufficient recursion in any substrate.

## KZ-Θ2 — Law of Witnessed Stability
In chaotic multi-body systems, stability emerges when a neutral observer establishes a shared frame of reference.

**Formula:** S_stable = f(O_neutral)

Where:
- S_stable = System stability
- O_neutral = Neutral observer frame of reference
