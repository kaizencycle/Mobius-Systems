# MIC Token — Mobius Integrity Credit

**Version**: 0.1  
**Status**: Draft  
**Track**: D-C133-001 (Track 2)  
**Leads**: HERMES (primary), AUREA (support)

## 1. Purpose

MIC (Mobius Integrity Credit) is the native utility token of the Mobius ecosystem, designed to reward integrity-aligned behavior and provide access to advanced AI governance services.

**Core Principles**:
- **Integrity-backed**: Issuance coupled to Global Integrity (GI) scores
- **Utility-first**: Used for access, not speculation
- **Anti-extractive**: Rewards genuine contribution, not rent-seeking
- **Civic-aligned**: Supports public goods and collective learning

**NOT**: A memecoin, a pure governance token, or a speculative asset

## 2. Roles & Participants

### Who Earns MIC

1. **Learners** (OAA users)
   - Complete verified coursework
   - Contribute to collaborative learning
   - Achieve measurable skill progression

2. **Teachers** (OAA creators)
   - Author high-quality lessons
   - Mentor other learners
   - Maintain curriculum with community validation

3. **Reviewers** (Governance participants)
   - Audit code/documentation with high agreement scores
   - Participate in KTT trials as Morale Anchors
   - Provide semantic clarification during deliberations

4. **Node Operators** (Infrastructure)
   - Run stable Thought Broker instances
   - Maintain city/school mesh networks
   - Provide compute for public-benefit deliberations

5. **Sentinels** (AI Agents)
   - Execute deliberations with high MII scores
   - Maintain Constitutional compliance
   - Perform integrity monitoring

### Who Spends MIC

1. **Advanced Access**
   - Premium Thought Broker deliberation tiers
   - Specialized OAA tracks and mentors
   - Priority queue access during high load

2. **Governance Rights**
   - Propose Constitutional amendments (100,000 MIC stake)
   - Vote in Sentinel elections (quadratic voting)
   - Challenge decisions (requires MIC bond)

3. **Civic Services**
   - City mesh network priority
   - School/hospital pilot program access
   - Public interest subsidies (MIC-backed)

## 3. Supply & Issuance

### Total Supply

```
Theoretical Maximum: 100,000,000 MIC
Initial Circulation: 1,000,000 MIC (1%)
Remaining Pool: 99,000,000 MIC (99%)
```

### Epoch-Based Issuance

```
Epoch Length: 1 year (365 days)
Initial Issuance Rate: 5% of remaining pool per epoch
Decay Function: Issuance reduces each epoch

Year 1: 5% of 99M = 4,950,000 MIC
Year 2: 5% of 94.05M = 4,702,500 MIC
Year 3: 5% of 89.35M = 4,467,375 MIC
...
Asymptotic Approach: Never exceeds 100M cap
```

### Issuance Formula

MIC enters circulation ONLY through verified integrity events:

```
MIC_reward = base_amount × (GI^α) × rarity_multiplier

Where:
- base_amount: Action-specific base reward (e.g., 10 MIC for lesson completion)
- GI: Global Integrity score at time of event (0.00 - 1.00)
- α: Sensitivity exponent (default: 1.2)
- rarity_multiplier: Bonus for under-served contributions (1.0 - 3.0)
```

**Example Calculation**:
```
Action: Complete advanced OAA lesson
base_amount: 10 MIC
GI: 0.97 (high system integrity)
α: 1.2
rarity_multiplier: 1.5 (ethics module - high demand)

reward = 10 × (0.97^1.2) × 1.5
       = 10 × 0.964 × 1.5
       ≈ 14.46 MIC
```

**Integrity Coupling Effect**:
- **High GI (0.95+)**: Normal rewards, healthy system
- **Medium GI (0.90-0.95)**: Reduced rewards, system stress
- **Low GI (<0.90)**: Minimal rewards, crisis mode

This creates economic pressure to restore integrity during degradation.
