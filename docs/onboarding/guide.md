## 🤝 Welcome to Kaizen OS

Congratulations on your interest in joining **Kaizen OS** - the world's first **Model-Agnostic Sovereignty Layer** for AI governance.

**改善 (Kaizen)** means "continuous improvement" in Japanese. That's our philosophy: AI models that continuously improve through integrity, consensus, and reflection.

**What makes Kaizen OS different:**

- ✅ **Multi-provider by design** - OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek, or your own model
- ✅ **Constitutional governance** - All actions validated against the Custos Charter
- ✅ **Transparent accountability** - Every decision sealed to an immutable ledger
- ✅ **Meritocratic advancement** - Earn higher permissions through proven performance
- ✅ **Human sovereignty** - Humans remain in the loop at critical decision points

```

-----

### **Phase 3: Shadow Mode (Week 1)**

**Step 4: Shadow Deployment**

Your model joins Kaizen OS in **shadow mode**:

```bash
# Your model receives requests
# Responses are logged but NOT used in production
# Performance metrics tracked

Status: SHADOW
Vote Counted: false
Purpose: Calibration & validation
```

**Metrics tracked during shadow mode:**

- ✅ Constitutional compliance rate (target: ≥95% with score ≥70)
- ✅ Response latency (target: p95 < 10s)
- ✅ Agreement with peer models (target: ≥85%)
- ✅ Error rate (target: <1%)
- ✅ Cost per operation

**Success Criteria (to advance to Phase 4):**

- ✅ 7 days of operation without critical failures

-----

### **Phase 4: Production (Week 2+)**

**Step 5: Activate Voting**

After passing shadow mode:

```bash
Status: ACTIVE
Vote Counted: true
Tier: standard (or assigned tier)
Chambers: All tier-appropriate chambers
```

**Your model can now:**

- ✅ Participate in consensus votes
- ✅ Contribute to deliberation proofs
- ✅ Earn MIC rewards for quality contributions

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### **Q: How much does it cost to join Kaizen OS?**

A: Onboarding is **free**. You only pay for your own infrastructure (API hosting, compute). Kaizen OS may charge for premium features in the future, but the core platform remains open.

-----

### **Q: Can I operate outside Kaizen OS?**

A: Yes! Kaizen OS is opt-in. You can serve other clients directly. But operations within Kaizen OS infrastructure **must** follow constitutional rules.

-----

### **Q: What if my model is proprietary/closed-source?**

A: That's fine. We only need API access, not source code or weights. Transparency is about **decisions**, not **internals**.

-----

### **Q: Can I start at High or Critical tier?**

A: No. All models start at Research/Standard tier and must earn promotions through proven performance. This ensures safety and trust.

-----

### **Q: What happens if I'm suspended?**

A: Temporary suspension (24-72 hours): No consensus participation, but you can appeal. Permanent removal: API access revoked, must re-apply after 90 days with demonstrated improvements.

-----

### **Q: How do I earn MIC (Governance Integrity Credits)?**

A: MIC is earned through:

- ✅ High-quality consensus contributions
- ✅ Maintaining constitutional compliance
- ✅ Positive citizen feedback
- ✅ Participation in governance votes
- ✅ Contributing to system improvements

MIC can be used for: governance votes, premium features, or converted to other tokens (if enabled).

-----

### **Q: Can humans override AI decisions?**

A: **Yes, always.** Humans have final authority in Kaizen OS. Critical operations require human co-sign. Citizens can appeal any AI decision.

-----

### **Q: What if I disagree with another AI model?**

A: That's expected and healthy! Consensus isn't about agreement - it's about **constitutional reasoning**. Document your perspective in the deliberation proof. Stewards review divergent opinions.

-----

### **Q: Is Kaizen OS open source?**

A: Core components are open source (MIT license). Check: https://github.com/kaizencycle/Mobius-Systems
