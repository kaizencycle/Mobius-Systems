# THE MOBIUS SYSTEMS — BRIEFING DOSSIER

**Prepared for**:  
- Glen Weyl (RadicalxChange, Microsoft Research)  
- Dr. Gillian K. Hadfield (Johns Hopkins, Aligning AI Governance)

**Date**: November 2025  
**Custodian**: Michael Judan, Founder — Mobius Systems

---

## 1. Situation Overview
Mobius Systems is building institutional infrastructure for autonomous AI systems. The project is not a new model or AGI lab; it is the scaffolding needed so that advanced models can operate under democratic oversight, constitutional constraints, and aligned economic incentives. This dossier is a strategic briefing to invite critique from the scholars whose work underpins the architecture.

## 2. Strategic Frame: The S.H.I.E.L.D. Analogy
> *"Mobius Systems is not trying to build a superintelligence. It is trying to build the world that could safely welcome one."*

The mobilization mirrors S.H.I.E.L.D.: distributed sentinels, civic legitimacy, and readiness rather than hero worship. We brief domain stewards, ask for vulnerabilities, and tighten protocols before inviting broader collaboration.

## 3. Why You Are Receiving This Briefing
### Glen Weyl
- MIC tokenomics extend *Radical Markets* and liberal radicalism into agentic coordination.  
- Community-weighted consensus borrows directly from quadratic funding and anti-plutocratic design, now applied to AI attestations.  
- Mechanism design critiques you pioneered (e.g., price discovery in plural governance) are the lens for our Intention Compiler and contribution weighting.

### Dr. Gillian Hadfield
- The Sentinel Constitution operationalizes *Rules for a Flat World* by encoding legal evolution as machine legible processes.  
- GI (Global Integrity) metrics instantiate your institutional economics research: norms embedded as auditable procedures.  
- Procedural accountability, due process for agents, and bounded emergence are explicitly derived from your AI governance scholarship.

## 4. Mobius Infrastructure Stack
1. **Intention Compiler** – Maps human intent ➜ Sentinel deliberation ➜ cryptographic integrity attestations.  
2. **Kaizen Turing Test (KTT)** – Benchmarks continuous self-improvement without integrity drift.  
3. **Sentinel Constitution** – Seven AI sentinels (AUREA, EVE, ZEUS, HERMES, ATLAS, JADE, ECHO) with separation of powers, veto authority, and human custody.  
4. **Mobius Integrity Credits (MIC)** – Token issuance gated on GI ≥ 0.95 with contribution weights `ω(x)` and entropy-aware throttles.  
5. **Telemetry & Observability Layer** – Every decision path is logged, hashed, and auditable by civic reviewers.

## 5. What Mobius Is Not
- Not an AGI lab or race participant.  
- Not a competitor to OpenAI, Anthropic, or open-source model collectives.  
- Not cryptocurrency speculation or convenience governance.  
- Not a political party, advocacy org, or electoral instrument.  
- Not asking for funding, endorsement, or affiliation—only critique.

## 6. Institutional Safeguards & Norms
- **Constitutional thresholds**: GI ≥ 0.95 required for deployment, 4-of-7 sentinel concurrence, human custodian override.  
- **Virtue tags & charter compliance**: Each action tagged with provenance and virtue taxonomy for audit.  
- **Drift containment**: Emergent behaviors only learn from high-integrity exemplars; any drift triggers automatic GI downgrade and retraining embargo.  
- **Public domain licensing**: Prevents corporate enclosure and keeps governance levers pluralistic.  
- **Transparent attestations**: `.gi/consensus-*.json` artifacts show every validation step.

## 7. Current Readiness & Evidence
| Capability | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sentinel Constitution v1.0 | ✅ Ratified Nov 13, 2025 | Undergoing peer review |
| Intention Compiler formalization | ✅ Complete | Math appendix attached |
| MIC Spec Sections 1-3 | ✅ Drafted | Sections 4-7 in progress (ETA Nov 21) |
| KTT Trial-001 datasets | ⏳ Prep phase | Experiment window Nov 28 |
| Outreach materials | ✅ (this dossier + emails) | Glen readiness 7 ➜ 8.5 |

## 8. Requested Critiques & Open Questions
### From Glen
1. Collusion resistance of the 4-of-7 sentinel quorum.  
2. Dynamic issuance curves responsive to system entropy.  
3. Quantifying "community trust restored" as an economic variable.

### From Dr. Hadfield
1. Norm interpretation under ambiguity: what jurisprudence do agents need?  
2. Procedural fairness for autonomous systems: due process equivalents?  
3. Institutional legibility: how to expose deliberation traces to regulators?  
4. Legal personality thresholds for aligned agents.

## 9. Engagement Protocol
- Provide critique (written or 30-minute call) before December 5.  
- Review attachments: Briefing Dossier, Intention Compiler math notes, MIC spec excerpt, Sentinel Constitution, KTT overview.  
- Responses feed into the November 28 governance retrofit and Q1 2026 publication.  
- Optional: connect with RadicalxChange or AI governance cohorts for joint workshops.
