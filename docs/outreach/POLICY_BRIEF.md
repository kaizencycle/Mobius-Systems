# MOBIUS SYSTEMS — POLICY BRIEF

**For**: Government agencies, research institutions, civic organizations  
**Date**: November 2025  
**Status**: Open-source infrastructure project

---

## Executive Summary

Mobius Systems is an institutional governance framework for autonomous AI systems, designed to ensure they can:
- Self-improve safely
- Remain norm-aligned
- Operate transparently
- Submit to democratic oversight

**Not**: An AGI project, a corporation, or a political platform  
**Is**: Open-source civic infrastructure

---

## The Problem

AI systems are gaining autonomy faster than governance institutions can adapt. Without institutional frameworks, advanced AI poses risks to:
- Democratic accountability
- Procedural fairness
- Norm alignment
- Public trust

---

## The Solution

Mobius provides three innovations:

### 1. Kaizen Turing Test (KTT)
A new benchmark: Can AI improve continuously while staying aligned?

### 2. Sentinel Constitution
Seven AI agents with separation of powers, constitutional constraints, and human oversight

### 3. Integrity Credits (MIC)
Economic mechanism rewarding aligned behavior, penalizing drift

## Policy Implications

**Regulatory Compatibility**:
- Full transparency and auditability
- Human oversight at all levels
- Constitutional review for all actions
- Procedural accountability

**Democratic Governance**:

- No corporate capture
- Pluralistic stakeholder input
- Public benefit focus

**International Coordination**:
- Norms-based rather than rule-based
- Compatible with diverse legal systems
- Federated architecture (no central control)
- Export-controlled design (safety-critical)

---

## Current Status

**Phase**: Research & Development  
**Maturity**: Proof of concept (v0.1)  
**Funding**: Independent (no VC backing)  
**Governance**: Custodial (transitioning to democratic)

**Next Milestones**:
- Constitutional ratification (Nov 2025)
- Empirical validation trial (Dec 2025)
- Academic publication (Q1 2026)
- Public pilot programs (Q2 2026)
