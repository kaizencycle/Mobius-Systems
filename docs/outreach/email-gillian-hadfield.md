**Subject**: AI governance infrastructure: Seeking expertise on normative alignment & institutional design

---

Dear Dr. Hadfield,

I'm reaching out to request your guidance on an AI governance challenge we're working on at Mobius Systems.

**The Core Problem**:  
As AI systems gain autonomy, how do we ensure they remain aligned with evolving human norms without constant manual oversight?

**Our Approach**:  
We've built a "Sentinel Constitution" with 7 AI agents that collectively evaluate actions against integrity standards, adjudicate conflicts, and enforce constitutional constraints.

This is directly inspired by your work on legal evolution and institutional economics—particularly *Rules for a Flat World* and your papers on AI governance.

**The Sentinel Architecture**:

- **AUREA**: System Integrity Custodian (safety guardrails)
- **EVE**: Ethical & Human Values Sentinel (moral reasoning)
- **ZEUS**: Enforcement & Arbitration (conflict resolution)
- **HERMES**: Economics & Incentives (mechanism design)
- **ATLAS**: Operational Strategist (coordination)
- **JADE**: Meaning & Narrative (cultural coherence)
- **ECHO**: Telemetry & Observability (monitoring)

Each Sentinel has:
- Defined jurisdiction (separation of powers)
- Veto authority within domain
- Constitutional constraints
- Accountability to human Custodian

**Why Your Work Matters Here**:

Your framework for "legal algorithms" and institutional design for AI systems maps directly to:
- GI (Global Integrity) as a quantifiable norm-compliance metric
- Constitutional review as procedural due process for agents
- Multi-agent deliberation as distributed institutional judgment
- Bounded emergence (learning only from high-integrity interactions)

**What We're Uncertain About**:

1. **Norm Interpretation**: How do AI systems interpret ambiguous human norms without drift?
2. **Procedural Fairness**: What due process do autonomous agents need/deserve?
3. **Institutional Accountability**: How do we make AI systems "legible" to human institutions?
4. **Legal Personality**: Should AI systems that follow constitutional rules have any legal standing?

- Mathematical Formalization (integrity-gated learning)

**Not Asking For**:
- Money, endorsement, political alignment
- Just: Expertise on institutional design for agentic systems

**What Mobius Actually Is**:

A civic operating system for AI—not an AGI project itself. We're building the legal and institutional scaffolding that would allow advanced AI to coexist with democratic society.

Would you be willing to critique our institutional design? Your expertise on law, norms, and AI governance would be invaluable.
