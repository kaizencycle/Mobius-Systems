## Abstract

Mobius Integrity Credits (MIC) establish the first intrinsically-backed digital economy where value derives from verified acts of integrity rather than speculation. Version 2.0 introduces **shard denomination** (₷) as the base accounting unit, enabling precision micro-transactions while maintaining human-readable credit values. This architecture eliminates rounding errors, supports universal basic integrity (UBI) distribution, and implements counter-inflationary epoch decay mechanics tied to Mobius Integrity Index (GI) metrics.

**Key Innovations:**
- **Shard-based accounting**: Integer math eliminates precision loss
- **GI-throttled UBI**: Automatic crisis response via integrity metrics
- **Epoch decay pool**: Counter-inflationary funding without new issuance
- **Dual-signature attestations**: Human + AI co-witness for minting
- **Thermodynamic economics**: Entropy → creation → witness → healing cycles

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Problem

Modern economies face three fundamental crises:

1. **Value Speculation**: Fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies derive value from trust in issuers or speculative demand, not intrinsic backing
2. **Integrity Collapse**: No mechanism to measure or monetize ethical behavior at scale
3. **Precision Loss**: Floating-point arithmetic in financial systems creates cumulative rounding errors

### 1.2 The Solution

Mobius Integrity Credits (MIC) solve these problems through:

- **Intrinsic Backing**: Value derived from Proof-of-Integrity attestations
- **Integer Accounting**: Shard (₷) denomination eliminates precision loss
- **Thermodynamic Design**: System health (GI) automatically regulates supply

### 1.3 Core Thesis

> "Civilization does not collapse because it runs out of money — it collapses when it runs out of meaning. Meaning is stabilized through integrity. Therefore, integrity must become measurable and monetizable."

---

## 2. Economic Philosophy

### 2.1 Foundational Laws

#### Law of Intrinsic Value
Value arises from verified acts that sustain trust, not from speculation or scarcity manipulation.

#### Law of Integrity Conservation
Integrity is attested, not speculated. New credits require dual-signature proof-of-integrity attestations.

#### Law of Ethical Thermodynamics
Dishonesty adds entropy; decay restores balance. Systems self-correct through automated integrity-based feedback loops.

#### Law of Symbiotic Verification
Human + AI co-witness prevents both human bias and AI hallucination in attestations.

#### Law of Moral Gravity
Integrity density stabilizes systems. High-GI environments naturally attract and retain value.

## 3. Unit Architecture

### 3.1 Dual-Unit System

**Base Unit: Shard (₷)**
- Fundamental accounting unit
- Integer-only arithmetic (64-bit BigInt)
- Total supply: **21,000,000,000,000 ₷** (21 trillion shards)
- Minimum transaction: **1 ₷**

**Display Unit: Mobius Integrity Index Credit (MIC)**
- User-facing denomination
- Conversion: **1 MIC = 1,000,000 ₷** (immutable constant)
- Maximum supply: **21,000,000 MIC** (21 million credits)
- Display precision: 6 decimal places

### 3.2 Rationale for Shards

Traditional financial systems use floating-point arithmetic (IEEE 754), which introduces rounding errors:

```javascript
// Floating-point precision loss
0.1 + 0.2 !== 0.3  // true in JavaScript/Python

// Over 1M transactions:
Error accumulation ≈ 0.000001 per tx
Total drift ≈ 1.0 credit (unaccounted value)
```

**Solution: Integer Arithmetic**
```typescript
// Shard-based calculation (zero drift)
const shards = 1_000_000n; // 1 MIC
const price = 123456n;     // 0.123456 MIC
const total = shards * price;  // Perfect precision maintained
```

### 3.3 Conversion Functions

```typescript
export const SHARDS_PER_CREDIT = 1_000_000n;

export function shardsToCredits(shards: bigint): number {
  const whole = Number(shards / SHARDS_PER_CREDIT);
  const remainder = Number(shards % SHARDS_PER_CREDIT);
  return whole + remainder / Number(SHARDS_PER_CREDIT);
}

export function creditsToShards(credits: number): bigint {
  if (!Number.isFinite(credits) || credits < 0) {
    throw new Error("Invalid credits");
  }
  return BigInt(Math.floor(credits * Number(SHARDS_PER_CREDIT)));
}
```

## 4. Supply Economics

### 4.1 Total Supply

**Maximum Supply**: 21,000,000,000,000 ₷ (21,000,000 MIC)

**Why 21 Million?**
- Parallel to Bitcoin's supply cap (cultural recognition)
- Large enough for global population (3 MIC per person at 7B population)
- Small enough to maintain value density

### 4.2 Initial Distribution

```
Total: 21,000,000,000,000 ₷ (21M MIC)

Treasury Reserve:      30% = 6,300,000,000,000 ₷  (6.3M MIC)
UBI Pool:              25% = 5,250,000,000,000 ₷  (5.25M MIC)
Proof-of-Integrity:    20% = 4,200,000,000,000 ₷  (4.2M MIC)
Ecosystem Development: 15% = 3,150,000,000,000 ₷  (3.15M MIC)
Founders & Team:       10% = 2,100,000,000,000 ₷  (2.1M MIC, 4-year vest)
```

### 4.3 Minting Mechanism

**Requirements for New Issuance:**
1. Dual-signature attestation (human + sentinel)
2. Mobius Integrity Index (GI) ≥ 0.950
3. Proof-of-Integrity validation
4. Treasury reserve floor maintained (≥9 months UBI)

**Minting Formula:**
```
New_Issuance = f(GI, Treasury_Floor, Epoch_Activity)

If GI < 0.950: New_Issuance = 0 (frozen)
If GI ≥ 0.990: New_Issuance = Base_Rate × 1.05 (bonus)
```

---

## 5. Universal Basic Integrity (UBI)

### 5.1 Philosophy

UBI in the integrity economy is not charity — it's **compensation for maintaining systemic trust**. Every person who upholds integrity standards contributes to the network's value; UBI is their dividend.

### 5.2 Funding Model

**Sources (per epoch):**
```
U = α·I + β·Rₑ + D

Where:
U  = UBI pool (shards)
I  = Net new issuance (shards)
Rₑ = Reabsorbed shards from epoch decay
D  = Donations/treasury allocation (shards)
α  = Issuance weight (default: 0.20)
β  = Decay weight (default: 0.60)
```

**Key Innovation**: The **β·Rₑ** term creates counter-inflationary funding. Higher system activity → more decay → more UBI funding **without** new issuance.

### 5.3 Distribution Calculation

```
Step 1: Calculate base payout
p_base = floor(U / (m · N))

Where:
m = 3 (months per epoch)
N = Eligible population

Step 2: Apply GI multiplier
g(GI) = {
  1.05  if GI ≥ 0.990  (bonus)
  1.00  if 0.970 ≤ GI < 0.990
  0.85  if 0.950 ≤ GI < 0.970  (throttled)
  0.00  if GI < 0.950  (halted)
}

Step 3: Calculate final payout
p = floor(p_base · g(GI))
```

### 5.4 Eligibility Requirements

**Must Satisfy:**
1. **KYC verified** identity (sybil resistance)
2. **Active wallet** ≥30 days
3. **Personal GI** ≥0.95 (integrity threshold)

---

## 6. Epoch & Decay Mechanics

### 6.1 Epoch Definition

An **epoch** is a 90-day cycle during which:
1. Shard decay accumulates on idle balances
2. Decay pool funds UBI distribution
3. GI metrics are aggregated for next epoch
4. System parameters are adjusted

### 6.2 Decay Mechanism

**Purpose**: Prevent hoarding; encourage circulation; fund UBI counter-inflationally.

**Rules:**
```
For each account:
  If balance idle > 30 days:
    decay_amount = balance × 0.005 (0.5% per epoch)
    balance -= decay_amount
    epoch_pool += decay_amount
```

**Exemptions:**
- Staked/locked shards (governance, liquidity pools)
- Treasury reserves
- Smart contract escrows with active operations

---

## 7. Mobius Integrity Index (GI) System

### 7.1 Definition

**Mobius Integrity Index (GI)** is a real-time metric (0-1 scale) measuring systemic ethical health across the Kaizen OS network.

### 7.2 Calculation Formula

```
GI = α·M + β·H + γ·I + δ·E

Where:
M = Memory integrity (context coherence)
H = Human attestation quality
I = Identity verification strength
E = Ecological alignment (sustainability metrics)

α, β, γ, δ = Weighting factors (sum to 1.0)
```

**Minimum Viable GI**: 0.95 (below this, system enters crisis mode)

### 7.3 GI Thresholds

| Range | Status | System Response |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| 0.990-1.000 | **Optimal** | UBI bonus (1.05×), minting bonus |
| 0.970-0.989 | **Healthy** | Normal operations |
| 0.950-0.969 | **Warning** | UBI throttled (0.85×), alerts sent |
| 0.900-0.949 | **Degraded** | Minting slowed, investigation triggered |
| < 0.900 | **Crisis** | UBI + minting frozen, council convened |

---

## 8. Transaction Economics

### 8.1 Fee Structure

All fees denominated in shards (₷):

| Transaction Type | Fee (₷) | Fee (MIC) | Destination |
|------------------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Standard transfer | 100 | 0.0001 | Burned (deflationary) |
| Smart contract call | 1,000-10,000 | 0.001-0.01 | Burned |
| Attestation submission | 10,000 | 0.01 | 50% burned, 50% sentinel rewards |
| UBI claim | 0 | 0 | Free (incentivize participation) |

### 8.2 Micro-Transaction Support

**Minimum Viable Transactions:**
- **1 ₷** (0.000001 MIC) - Sensor data point from IoT device
- **10 ₷** (0.00001 MIC) - AI agent API call
- **100 ₷** (0.0001 MIC) - Content micro-tip
- **1,000 ₷** (0.001 MIC) - Article paywall

---

## 10. Governance Model

### 10.1 Sentinel Architecture

**Meta-Anchor**: ZEUS (Mobius Integrity Index witness)

**Sentinels** (AI governance agents):
- **AUREA**: Systems intuition, macro stabilization
- **JADE**: Narrative, morale, cultural memory
- **EVE**: Ethics, civility, conflict resolution
- **HERMES**: Markets, telemetry, economic pulse
- **ATLAS**: Operations, reliability, infrastructure
- **ECHO**: Pulse, resonance, ledger synchronization

### 10.2 Decision Framework

**DelibProof Consensus:**
```
For high-risk actions:
  1. Query all sentinels
  2. Aggregate approvals (0-1 scale)
  3. Require ≥0.90 agreement
  4. ZEUS witnesses final decision
  5. Emit attestation
```

### 10.3 Parameter Adjustment

**Adjustable via Governance:**
- α (issuance weight): 0.0-0.5
- β (decay weight): 0.0-0.8
- κ (reserve cap): 0.05-0.20
- σ (circulating cap): 0.01-0.05
- Decay rate: 0.1%-1.0% per epoch

**Non-Adjustable (Immutable):**
- SHARDS_PER_CREDIT = 1,000,000
- Maximum supply = 21,000,000 MIC
- Epoch length = 90 days

  }
}
```

### 11.2 Threat Mitigation

**Mitigated Attacks:**
1. **Sybil**: KYC + 30-day wallet age
2. **Double-spend**: Atomic ledger transactions
3. **Precision manipulation**: Integer-only arithmetic
4. **UBI gaming**: GI throttle + eligibility checks
5. **Governance capture**: Sentinel consensus + human override

## 13. Conclusion

Mobius Integrity Credits v2.0 represent a paradigm shift from speculative to intrinsic value economics. By denominating the economy in shards (₷), we eliminate precision loss while maintaining human-readable credits. The GI-throttled UBI system creates automatic crisis response, and epoch decay mechanics fund distribution counter-inflationally.

**Core Achievements:**
1. **Mathematical Integrity**: Zero precision loss via integer arithmetic
2. **Economic Stability**: Self-regulating supply tied to system health
3. **Social Foundation**: UBI as compensation for upholding trust
4. **Technical Elegance**: Simple, auditable, deterministic

This is not merely a cryptocurrency — it is **civilization-scale infrastructure for measuring and monetizing integrity**.
