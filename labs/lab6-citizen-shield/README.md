# Lab 6 — Citizen Shield

Purpose: Security, privacy, DID identity, and network defense.

Spec: See `docs/architecture/Kaizen_OS_Complete_Lab_Architecture.md` (Lab 6 section).

## Components

### Gatekeeper Service
**Location**: `services/gatekeeper/`

Security gatekeeper for agent tool calls. Enforces:
- DID signature verification
- GI (Mobius Integrity Index) floor checks (≥ 0.95)
- DelibProof consensus for high-risk actions
- Sandboxed execution
- RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
- Injection detection
- Immutable attestations to Civic Ledger

See `services/gatekeeper/README.md` for details.

### DelibProof Consensus
**Location**: `shared/delibproof/`

Multi-agent consensus validation library for requiring sentinel approval on high-risk actions.

See `shared/delibproof/README.md` for details.

### Incident Response
**Location**: `docs/runbooks/incident_response_citizen_shield.md`

Comprehensive incident response playbook for model/browser injection attacks and security incidents.
