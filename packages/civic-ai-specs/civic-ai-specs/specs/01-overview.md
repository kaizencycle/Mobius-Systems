*We heal as we walk.*

## Introduction

The Civic AI Standard defines an open, verifiable framework for ethical artificial intelligence systems that serve the common good. This standard combines technical innovation with cultural wisdom to create AI systems that are not only powerful but also aligned with human values and community needs.

## Core Philosophy

### "We heal as we walk"
This phrase encapsulates our approach: we don't wait for perfect solutions, but rather improve and heal our systems as we build and use them. Every step forward is an opportunity for growth and healing.

### Principles
1. **Transparency**: All AI decisions must be explainable and auditable
2. **Accountability**: Clear responsibility chains for AI actions
3. **Community**: AI serves the community, not just individual interests
4. **Integrity**: Systems must be verifiable and tamper-resistant
5. **Growth**: Continuous learning and improvement

## Architecture Overview

### OAA (Online Apprenticeship Agent)
The learning and reflection engine that enables AI systems to:
- Learn from interactions
- Reflect on their actions
- Improve over time
- Maintain ethical alignment

### DVA (Digital Vector Architecture)
The governance and integrity kernel that provides:
- Decision-making frameworks
- Ethical constraint enforcement
- Community input integration
- Conflict resolution mechanisms

### Civic Ledger Core
A proof-of-integrity ledger that:
- Records all AI decisions and actions
- Provides cryptographic proof of authenticity
- Enables audit trails
- Supports reputation systems

### MIC (Mobius Integrity Index Credit)
An incentive and reputation economy that:
- Rewards ethical behavior
- Penalizes harmful actions
- Enables community governance
- Supports sustainable development

## Key Features
