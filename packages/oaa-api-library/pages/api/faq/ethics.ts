        "text": "The Integrity Core is a scoring and governance kernel that enforces Truth, Trust, and Care across all AI agents, code, and content in the Civic AI ecosystem. It ensures verifiable ethical behavior through cryptographic attestation and provides the foundation for the Virtue Accords framework."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Ethics are verified through multiple layers: hash/signature attestation to the Civic Ledger, cross-checks in CI pipelines (human + agent + Copilot), compliance with the Virtue Accords framework, and cryptographic proof of integrity for all contributions and outputs."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The Virtue Accords define the three civic virtues that govern agent behavior: Truth (no fabrication, accurate representation), Trust (transparent provenance, verifiable lineage), and Care (avoid harm, promote wellbeing, consider consequences). These form the ethical foundation of the Civic AI ecosystem."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Violations result in integrity score penalties, reduced MIC rewards, and potential exclusion from the civic ecosystem until remediation. The system is designed to encourage self-correction and learning while maintaining high ethical standards."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The Integrity Core provides APIs and protocols that AI systems can integrate to verify their outputs, attest to their behavior, and maintain compliance with civic standards. It works alongside existing AI frameworks to add ethical governance layers."
